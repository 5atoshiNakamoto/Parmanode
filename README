Parmanode 1.1 Plebian Cheese - Mac and Linux - Pre-Release
13 April 2023

Parmanode is a software package for home computers (Linux, Mac, and
maybe one day, Windows). The Linux version is tested and working. The Mac
version needs testing - use with caution, or just wait for the full
release.

Parmanode comes with an installation wizard so that non-technical users have
the ability to download and verify Bitcoin Core and sync using an external 
or internal drive, and also have configuration options presented to them
with automation. No manual bitcoin.conf file editing will be required.

The aim is that all people need to do is read the menu options carefully - 
no command line interaction is required. For example, bitcoin-cli commands
are available in a menu, and pruning can be activated from menu options.

The software also comes with helpful information, including links to various
articles on my website, armantheparman.com, so that Bitcoiners keep learning
more about Bitcoin and how to be safely self-sovereign. Information on how 
to connect various wallets to the node is provided in the menus. Much effort
has not been made for this aspect of the software in the first version; more
will be done later.

The most basic usage would be an internal drive to sync, running the latest
version of Bitcoin Core, and connecting Sparrow Bitcoin Wallet or Specter
Desktop Wallet directly to the node on the same computer.

DRIVE STRUCTURE (for when Parmanode software is installed with Bitcoin Core):

Internal drive:
               
               /|--- $HOME ---|
                |             |--- .bitcoin                        (may or may not be a symlink)
                |             |--- .parmanode                      (config files)
                |             |--- parmanode ---|
                |                               |--- bitcoin ---|  (keeps B core download and pgp stuff)
                |--- media ---|
                |             |--- parmanode ---|                  (ext drive mountpoint) 
                |                               |--- .bitcoin ---| (symlink target)
                |           
                |--- usr  --- |--- local  ------|--- bin ---|       (keeps bitcoin binary files)


If an external drive is used, a symlink on the internal drive will point to the .bitcoin directory.

               /|--- .bitcoin ---|
