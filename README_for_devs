                              #Notes to developers


Thank you, you lovely open source developers for contriubiting and reviewing the 
Parmanode code.

This document is to help quickly uderstand how the code works in a convenient place
rather than littered in hard-to-find places which you may end up reading but in an
inefficient order.

FREQUENTLY USED CUSTOM FUNCTIONS

    set_terminal    This is used a lot to clear the screen. It also sets the terminal
                    dimensions and changes the text colour to orange. It doesn't 
                    seem to be working on Mac, but it was at one stage. It's probably
                    a good thing as many mac terminals have a white background and
                    I failed at finding how to change it to black without mouse input.
                    If someone wants to take that on, that'd be awesome.
    
    debug           This is a useful function to help me debug and rarely present an
                    error to the user before aborting. It takes a string argument which
                    gets printed, before a read command so the screen doesn't clear, 
                    and devs or users can see the error message before continuing.

    choose          I have several functions that are echo statements to be printed
                    menu options, found in the echo_choices.sh file. "choose" takes
                    various string arguments. The letters mean: "x" - choose from
                    options above, "p" - text to offer option to go to the previous 
                    menu, and "q" text to offer user to quit.
    
    error.sh        This is a file with various error messages. I may expand on it or 
                    I might get rid of it all together. It's yet to be determined what
                    is best.

    delete_line     A useful sed function that takes two arguments, the filename and 
                    the string to find. It then removes every line where that string 
                    ocurrs. Useful for modifiying config files.


EXPLANATION OF CONFIGURATION FILES  

    parmanode.conf  Some user choices, like drive=external / internal, is kep in a config
                    file for easy access of variables selected during previous times the
                    software was run.
                
    installed.conf  Useful to know if an installation process has begun, eg bitcoin-start, 
                    in order to know if the user's system has been modified, and can 
                    direct the need for uninstallation or clean install. When something
                    has finised installing, the "end" line is added to the configuration
                    file, eg bitcoin-end, for similar reasons.

BITCOIN MAC COMMPILED BINARIES

    I have chosen to compile Bitcoin Core for Mac myself, as it is mostly a GUI based
    installation. It's not clear to me how to acces the daemon either, so I made a
    version, from source, which has no GUI, no wallet. The "no wallet" decision might be
    a mistake (to connect Sparrow), I'm not sure, I'm waiting to find out, and if is, 
    it's a simple matter of re-compiling and changing the binary offerred when Parmanode
    downloads it from parman.org. 

    Later, when that is cleared up, I will sign the binary with my gpg key, and 
    document the steps to reproduce it.
