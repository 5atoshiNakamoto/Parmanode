                                  BTC ParmanPay

    You might have set up your BTCPay store, but are having trouble making an app
    for people to pay you with, and even harder, making the app available outsite
    your home network - and even harder still, making it available without revealing
    to your customers or doners  what your home IP address is.

    Not to worry, it can be done, it's technially hard, but you can hire me to do 
    that for you via a couple of video calls.
